I want to be part of the solution, not of the problem.

Computer programming is a profession with low barrier to entry and in increasing
demand. Increasing demand is unlikely to change, and it places high importance
on the correctness of software. Users seem to expect more as they get used to
relying on software for almost everything.

My experience as a professional in the software industry up to year 2023 is
depressing. As software engineers we are an industry of hobbyists most of the
time. Perhaps unknowingly, we rely on our managers not knowing what we do to do
whatever we want, however we want, and then re-do it all over again just for the
sake of doing it. We make it all looks like progress to the non-technical
manager. We can push aside all that talk about algorithms and programming
theory, we can choose not to use any of that and then proudly say so: "I've
never needed any of that in my real job". What is thought in school is never put
into practice, and nobody seems to know why.

Sixteen years and two paragraphs later, I am changing that starting with
myself. I want to be able to identify distractions and tell them from what
really matters, and then not spend my time on them any longer. I want to move
forward, and not sideways. I want to know what in the world my programs will do
when executed, and for what cost. I want to use the right tool for the problem
at hand, without crying that it is too hard to learn yet another language.

Too much time is spent discussing irrelevant topics. I am moving on to an
engineering approach to software.
